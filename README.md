# The Use of Adaptive Learning Technology in Online Courses

**Authors: [Jason Bryer](jason.bryer@cuny.edu) and Bruce Homer**  

The use of technology to adapt learning to students' performance is not new (Skinner, 1958). However, with increased availability of computers, tablets, and smart phones, reimagining of Skinner's initial teaching machines has proliferated in the EdTech market. This study examines the use of Cerego, and adaptive learning technology framework, as a supplement to asynchronous online mathematics and biology courses. Using propensity score analysis to adjust for selection bias, results suggest that students who use Cerego as a supplement score between 5 and 13 percentage points higher than their non-using counterparts in most weekly quiz grades. Results suggest there is little or no impact on overall course grade, in large part due to the inconsistent use of Cerego throughout the course.
